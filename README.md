# btree-2d [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/astranet/btree-2d?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/astranet/btree-2d)

Package `btree-2d` implements a 2-dimensional B+tree data structure.<br/>
The B+tree implementation itself has been generated by http://github.com/cznic/b.

We leverage [github.com/joeshaw/gengen](https://github.com/joeshaw/gengen) here to provide a way to generate this data structure for any type you'd like.

This package has been created as an optimization for service and route maps syncing in [AstraNet](https://github.com/astranet/astranet), currently it works fine under heavy loads and reduces the CPU overhead and GC pressure as well.

## Getting

```
$ go get github.com/astranet/btree-2d
```

Do not forget to proceed with `gengen`. See [example.go](/example/example.go) on how to simplify this process.

## Example

A simple example with `string` and `int` types, see [example.go](/example/example.go) and the corresponding [example_test.go](/example/example_test.go) that yields the following:

```
$ go test

previous:
.
├── 1
│   └── [funcs: 1]  hello world
├── 2
│   └── two
└── 3
    └── three

next:
.
├── 3
│   └── replaced
└── 4
    └── four

added: [3(replaced) 4(four)]
deleted: [1(hello world) 2(two) 3(three)]
bye cruel world

after sync:
.
├── 3
│   └── replaced
└── 4
    └── four

PASS
```

For a more complex cases check out [astranet/route](https://github.com/astranet/astranet/tree/master/route) and [astranet/service](https://github.com/astranet/astranet/tree/master/service), that are the primary reasons why this package even exists.
